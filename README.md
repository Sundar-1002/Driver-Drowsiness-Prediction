# Driver Drowsiness prediction
 
We address a drowsy driver alert system that has been developed using such a technique in which the Video Stream Processing (VSP) is analyzed by eye blink concept through an Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Euclidean distance of the eye. Face landmark algorithm is also used as a proper way to eye detection. When the driverâ€™s fatigue is detected, the IoT module issues a warning message using a buzzer which beeps until the driver becomes full alert.
